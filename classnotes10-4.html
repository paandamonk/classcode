<!--
    Javascript is the best way to code browsers.
    CSS is the style for the browser.
    HTML is also used.

    Use libraries to code Javascript.
    Vue is a good library to use

    App server is going to be used as a web server as well.
    Node.js is what we will be using.

    web 1.0, web 2.0, web 3.0: 

    web 1.0: Example, amazon. Every time you interact with the website, you get a new page.
    Dynamic web server. Browser sends a response to the server, server sends back an html page.

    web 2.0: updating different aspects of your page so that you don't have to go through a whole 
    page refresh. Example, updating amazon's shopping cart icon after something is added to it.

    web 3.0: Makes a new application allowing people to create things. (?)
